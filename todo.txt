V1 - development:
* Better styling of links/animation on hover
* Add more actual responses. Pick from tabular editor video or facebook, or...?
* Better gif for nodding
* Fix root imports/aliases
* Fix styling of oracle/daniel avatar. Should be fully round circle, always centered horiz/vertic in its parent.
* Fix think-bubble. Write it using css-only, and make the text dynamic?

Release:
* Create a new azure website and host the thing there...

Future/experimental:
* Dynamic layout (mobile friendly) [the current one is actually close to being mobile friendly... only the top part of the layout lacks a bit]
* Experiment with external apis for fallback responses? e.g. google(?) or duckduckgo?
* Experiment with tailwind to replace styled components?
* Experiment with ChakraUI? or another component/design system. E.g. materialUI.
